# ShadowKickboxing (WIP + not functioning yet)

## Introduction

App for shadow kickboxing training and for practicing the Spring framework. This project is still in development.


## Acknowledgements

#### Fight

* By design, defensive moves are not part of the implementation. User will be called to defend against offensive moves instead (block/evade).
* Currently, it is assumed the user uses an orthodox stance. However, the calls themselves are stance agnostic but there is a slight difference in timing between left and right.


## Temporary notes

#### Unanswered development questions

* How to deal with stance (orthodox vs southpaw in combination with stance agnostic moves like the liver shot)?
    * User decides for himself.
    * Per fight instruction about stance.
    * Periodic instruction about stance.
