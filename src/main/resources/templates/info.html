                    <p>There are 2 general reasons for this shadow kickboxing mp3 generator:</p>
                    <p>1) For fun and practice. I wanted a unique training experience when training on my own. Once I created the bare bones, I decided to share this experience with the world.</p>
                    <p>2) As a practice project for working with the Spring framework while combining Java, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MVC, JPA, Docker and MySQL, among others. Everything is served from a Linux environment.</p>
